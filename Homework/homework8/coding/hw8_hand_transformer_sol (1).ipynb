You don't need to include the printing and plotting code found in the Numpy version. **You should implement a vectorized version of the attention operation**, meaning that you should calculate all attention scores at once, rather than looping over keys. Once you have completed your implementation, make sure it passes the tests included in the cell below."

        "\n",
        "In this coding homework, we will explore how Transformers can attend to different tokens in a variable-length sequence based on their contents. We will do this by **implementing a Transformer that performs the *identity* operation on a sequence of one-hot vectors**. We will then compare the performance and weights of this hand-coded Transformer with those of a PyTorch model trained on the same task.\n",
        "\n",
        "To hand-design the Transformer, we will **choose values for `Km`, `Qm`, and `Vm` that enable the model to attend to the content of each token in the input sequence**. We will then use this Transformer to process several example data points, and verify that the output matches the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once your hand-written Transformer is working correctly, we will run the PyTorch training loop to train a model on the identity operation task. We will then compare the weights and intermediate outputs of this model with those of our hand-coded transformer, and comment on their similarities and differences. Note that when we generate plots, we will rescale the range of the weights and outputs to 0-1, so we can compare their relative values without comparing absolute values.\n",
        "\n",
        "The test cases for our hand-coded transformer are as follows:\n",

Transformers typically use a sinusoidal positional encoding or a learned positional encoding, but we'll **set the weight by hand to any value we choose**. These positional encodings will get concatenated to the input sequence inside the Transformer. For simplicity, we'll *concatenate* the positional encoding to the input embeddings instead of adding it.\n",
