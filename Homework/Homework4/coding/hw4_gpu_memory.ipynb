        "# 3. Investigating the effect of batch size on convergence and GPU memory\n",
        "Batch size is an important parameter in training neural networks that can have a significant effect on GPU memory usage. The larger the batch size, the more data the model processes at once, and therefore, the more GPU memory it requires to store the inputs, activations, and gradients.\n",
        "\n",
        "As the batch size increases, the memory required to store the intermediate results during training increases linearly. This is because the model needs to keep track of more activations and gradients for each layer. However, the actual memory usage can also depend on the specific neural network architecture, as some models require more memory than others to process the same batch size.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the batch size is too large to fit in the available GPU memory, the training process will fail with an out-of-memory error. On the other hand, if the batch size is too small, the training may be slower due to inefficient use of the GPU, as the GPU may spend more time waiting for data to be transferred from CPU to GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, choosing an appropriate batch size is important to balance training speed and memory usage. This often involves some trial and error to find the largest batch size that can fit in the available GPU memory while still providing good training results.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Learning Rate and Batch Size\n",
        "\n",
        "Batch size and learning rate are closely related. When batch size is increased, the gradient estimate becomes less noisy because it is computed over more samples. As a result, the learning rate can be increased, allowing the optimization algorithm to take larger steps towards the optimum. This is because a larger batch size gives a more accurate estimate of the direction of the gradient and larger steps can reduce convergence time. \n",
        "\n",
        "Large batch training becomes particularly important in data-parallel distributed training, where extremely large batch sizes are distributed over many GPUs. The paper [\"Accurate, Large Minibatch SGD: Training ImageNet in 1 Hour\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf) is one of the earliest works showing how large batch training makes fast large scale distributed training possible. It also proposes a simple linear scaling rule for setting the learning rate for a given batch size, which we use to set learning rates in `LR_MAP` below.\n",
